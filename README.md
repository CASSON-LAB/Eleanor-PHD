# Eleanor-PHD
MATLAB code, written by Dr Alex Casson and PhD student Eleanor Trimble, to synchronise and analyse EEG and eye-tracking data in a consumer colour priming study

Due to the large size of the data files, raw_data has been uploaded as individual files. 
This may cause error calling the data from the wrong place.
Within the main folder there should be a file 'data'

Within the 'data' foler there should be two subsequent folders
\raw_data
\derived_data

Then within \raw_data there should be four subsequent folders:
\eeg
\experiment_groupings
\fixations
\tobii_gyro

The derived_data folders will save and store themselves as you run the various stages of the analysis.
